# Azure Key Vault is a secure and centralized service for storing and managing secrets, keys, and certificates that applications use for authentication and authorization. 

# Terraform can be used to fetch secrets and keys from an Azure Key Vault using the azurerm_key_vault_secret and azurerm_key_vault_key data sources.
# To fetch a secret from an Azure Key Vault using Terraform, you can use the azurerm_key_vault_secret data source as shown below:

# Provider configuration
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

# Resource group
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resource-group"
  location = "eastus"
}

# Key Vault
resource "azurerm_key_vault" "example" {
  name                        = "example-key-vault"
  location                    = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name         = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  tenant_id                   = "<your-tenant-id>"
  sku_name                    = "standard"
  soft_delete_enabled         = true
  purge_protection_enabled    = true
  enable_rbac_authorization   = true
  enabled_for_disk_encryption = false

  access_policy {
    tenant_id = "<your-tenant-id>"
    object_id = "<your-object-id>"
    secret_permissions = [
      "get",
      "list",
      "set",
      "delete",
      "backup",
      "restore",
    ]
  }

  tags = {
    environment = "production"
  }
}

# This code creates an Azure Key Vault in a resource group.
# The Key Vault has several configuration options, including enabling soft delete, enabling purge protection, enabling RBAC authorization, and enabling disk encryption. 
# The access policy allows a specific tenant and object to perform several operations on the Key Vault, including getting, listing, setting, deleting, backing up, and restoring secrets. 
# Finally, the Key Vault has a tag for identifying the environment.
# Note that this code is just an example and may need to be modified to suit your specific requirements. 
# Additionally, you will need to authenticate with Azure and configure the azurerm provider before running this code.
