# Azure Monitor Alerts is a service in Azure that provides monitoring and alerting capabilities for your Azure resources.

# To deploy an Azure Monitor Alert using Terraform, you can use the AzureRM provider, which allows you to create and manage Azure resources. 
# You can define the configuration of your alert in a Terraform configuration file, specifying the resource group, the target resource to monitor, and the alert criteria. 
# Once you have defined your configuration, you can use the Terraform command-line interface (CLI) to apply the changes and create the alert.

# In this example, the configuration file defines a resource group in the West US region, and then creates an Azure Monitor Alert for a Storage Account with a criteria that triggers an alert if the BlobCapacity metric for BlockBlob exceeds 1000 over a 5-minute period. 
# The alert will send an action group notification.
