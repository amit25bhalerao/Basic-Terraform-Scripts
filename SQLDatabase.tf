# This code creates an Azure SQL Database in a resource group and deploys it to a SQL Server.
# It also creates a firewall rule that allows all IP addresses to access the database, sets the database edition and collation, and sets the maximum size for the database. 
# Additionally, this code sets up an Active Directory administrator login for the SQL Server.
# Note that this code is just an example and may need to be modified to suit your specific requirements. 
# Additionally, you will need to authenticate with Azure and configure the azurerm provider before running this code.
