# SQL Firewall Rule is a security feature in Azure SQL Database that allows you to control access to your SQL Server instance based on IP address ranges. 
# It works by defining a set of IP address ranges that are allowed to connect to your SQL Server instance and blocking all other traffic.
# Firewall rules are defined at the server level, so they apply to all databases within the server. 
# In Terraform, you can use the azurerm_sql_firewall_rule resource to create, modify, or delete firewall rules programmatically. 
# The azurerm_sql_firewall_rule resource allows you to specify the start and end IP addresses for the firewall rule, as well as the name of the rule and the Azure SQL Server instance to which it applies.

# This code creates a SQL Firewall Rule on an existing Azure SQL Server that allows access from all IP addresses. 
# It creates the rule in a resource group named "example-resource-group" and assigns it to a SQL Server named "example-sql-server". 
# The start IP address is set to "0.0.0.0" and the end IP address is set to "255.255.255.255" to allow access from any IP address.
# Note that you can modify the values of the name, start_ip_address, and end_ip_address parameters to specify a different firewall rule name and a different range of IP addresses. 
# You can also use Terraform variables to make the code more reusable and parameterizable. 
# Additionally, you will need to authenticate with Azure and configure the azurerm provider before running this code.
