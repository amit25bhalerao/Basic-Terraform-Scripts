# Azure Function App is a service in Azure that allows you to build and deploy serverless applications. 

# To deploy an Azure Function App using Terraform, you can use the AzureRM provider, which allows you to create and manage Azure resources.
# You can define the configuration of your Function App in a Terraform configuration file, specifying the runtime, storage account, and other settings. 
# Once you have defined your configuration, you can use the Terraform command-line interface (CLI) to apply the changes and create the Function App.

# In this example, the configuration file defines a resource group in the West US region, and then creates an Azure Storage Account and an Azure Function App. 
# The Function App is configured to use a Docker image and the storage account for its data. 
# An App Service Plan is also created to host the Function App.
