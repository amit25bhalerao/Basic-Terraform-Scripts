# Azure Traffic Manager is a DNS-based traffic load balancer that distributes incoming traffic across multiple endpoints based on the routing method configured for the Traffic Manager profile.
# It is a global service that provides high availability and improved performance for applications by directing users to the closest or best-performing endpoint based on their location.
# Azure Traffic Manager supports a variety of routing methods including:
# -> Geographic routing - directs users to the endpoint that is closest to their geographic location.
# -> Performance routing - directs users to the endpoint with the lowest network latency or highest network bandwidth.
# -> Weighted routing - distributes traffic across endpoints based on a specified weight or priority.
# -> Priority routing - routes traffic to endpoints in a specified order of priority.
# -> Multi-value routing - allows multiple endpoints to be returned for a single DNS query.
# Azure Traffic Manager can be used with a wide variety of Azure services such as virtual machines, cloud services, and web apps, as well as external endpoints such as on-premises resources or third-party cloud providers.
# Traffic Manager can be managed using the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, the Azure CLI, or Terraform.

# In this example, we are creating an Azure Traffic Manager profile named "example-traffic-manager" in the resource group called "example-resource-group" in the "eastus" region. We are specifying that the traffic routing method should be "Performance", which means that the closest endpoint with the lowest latency will be used for each user.
# We also specify the DNS configuration with a relative name of "example" and a TTL of 60 seconds. 
# The monitor configuration specifies that the endpoint will be monitored using the HTTP protocol on port 80, and the path "/".
# Finally, we create an endpoint for the Traffic Manager profile that points to a target resource identified by its resource ID.
# In this example, the target resource ID would need to be replaced with the ID of the resource that you want to route traffic to.
# Note that this is a basic example, and you can add more endpoints and customize the configuration further to meet your specific needs.
