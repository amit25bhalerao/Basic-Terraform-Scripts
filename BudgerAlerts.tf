# Azure Budget Alert is a feature in Azure that allows you to monitor and manage your spending on Azure resources.

# To deploy an Azure Budget Alert using Terraform, you can use the AzureRM provider, which allows you to create and manage Azure resources. You can define the configuration of your budget alert in a Terraform configuration file, specifying the budget amount, the alert threshold, and the notification settings. Once you have defined your configuration, you can use the Terraform command-line interface (CLI) to apply the changes and create the alert.

# In this example, the configuration file defines a resource group in the West US region, and then creates an Azure Budget Alert for a budget of $500 for the year 2022. The alert will trigger when the actual cost exceeds 90% of the budgeted amount, and send an email notification to the specified email address.
