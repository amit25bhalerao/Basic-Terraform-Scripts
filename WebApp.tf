# A web app is a web application that is accessible over the internet through a web browser or a mobile app. 
# It can be a simple static website or a complex dynamic application that processes user requests and generates dynamic content.
# In Azure, you can host web apps using the Azure App Service, which is a fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web apps. 
# Azure App Service supports a variety of languages and frameworks, including .NET, Node.js, Java, Python, and PHP, among others.

# To create a web app in Azure using Terraform, you can use the azurerm_app_service_plan and azurerm_app_service resources.

# In this example, the code creates an Azure Web App in a resource group and deploys it to an App Service Plan. 
# It also configures the web app with a .NET framework version and sets an environment variable. 
# The code also creates a DNS CNAME record that maps to the web app's default hostname.
# Note that this code is just an example and may need to be modified to suit your specific requirements. 
# Additionally, you will need to authenticate with Azure and configure the azurerm provider before running this code.
